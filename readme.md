Hello!
I'm Zane West, a software engineer with a knack for optimizing team dynamics and transforming complex requirements into high-quality software solutions. With a strong background in both team leadership and hands-on development, I thrive on pushing the envelope in technology and process improvements.

My personal GitHub might look a bit sparse at the moment, primarily because my previous work has been closely tied to the closed-source projects at companies like Walmart and Scorpion. However, don't let that fool you! I am eager to showcase my technical abilities and problem-solving skills in a technical interview. I'm confident that a live coding session or a deep-dive into tech problems will demonstrate my capabilities more vividly than any repository could. Looking forward to discussing how my background, skills, and enthusiasms align with the needs of your team!
